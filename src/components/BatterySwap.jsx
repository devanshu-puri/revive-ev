            We're building Indiaâ€™s smartest network of battery swapping stations â€” because EV users shouldnâ€™t have to wait. Even in our early phase, we are piloting fast, reliable swaps starting with 2-wheelers and 3-wheelers.

            <li>Partnering with local garages and stores for scale</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="text-gray-600">
            Our goal is to decentralize power â€” literally. With each local partner, we're building a robust, fast-access grid that reduces wait times and enables constant EV uptime.
